## meesmeester
The meesmeester directory contains the files needed for the main [index.html file](index.html) in this repository. This site can be accessed at http://meesmeester.nl/. The site is not finished yet, but is a site for people who would like me to teach or tutor them in programming. 
## stampy
Stampy is an app which reveals impact of food in the the Albert Heijn (Dutch supermarket) based on their barcodes. The images in [ecoscore_images](/stampy/ecoscore_images/) are used to represent the scores of this product in the app. In [stampy_webapp](/stampy/stampy_webapp/). The web version of the Stampy app can be found, the barcode scanner itself doesn't work in the browser. But the app can be downloaded at http://app.stampy-app.nl. In [the stampy directory](/stampy/) the terms, conditions and privacy statement can be found regarding the app. The index.html is a copied (outdated) version of the Wix website: https://appstampy.wixsite.com/mysite.
## sympathize
In the process of creating a StartUp (which leaded to Stampy), Sympathize was one of our initial ideas. A platform to help people match to psychologists, counselors and psychology students. In [this directory](/sympathize/) the landingspage of this idea can be found. 
## Extra files
[git.sh](git.sh) is a simple bash script I wrote that helps me automate pull, add, commit and push with git. [sprites.png](sprites.png) is used for the minipaint software in a website I contributed to.
